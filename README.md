<h2>:book: Introduction </h2>
A company faces bankruptcy when they are unable to pay off their debts.  

Prediction of bankruptcy is a phenomenon of increasing interest to firms who stand to lose money because on unpaid debts. Since computers can store huge dataset pertaining to bankruptcy making accurate predictions from them before hand is becoming important.
<h2>:scroll: Objective </h2>
The main objective of this project is to use various classification algorithms on bankruptcy dataset to predict bankruptcies with satisfying accuracies long before the actual event.

<h2> :floppy_disk: Data </h2>
The data includes a majority of numerical attributes that help understand the possibility of bankruptcy. The Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009 has listed the details of company bankruptcy based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Project Description </h2>

* Exploratory Data Analysis - Performed exploratory data analysis on numerical and categorical data.
* Data Cleaning - Dealing with highly imbalaced dataset
* Model Development - Tried Classification models like Random Forest Classifier and K Nearest Neighbour
* Model Evaluation - Comparison of different classification models for final selection of the model based on their performance

<h2>üñ•Ô∏è Random Forest Classifier: </h2>
The Random forest or Random Decision Forest is a supervised Machine learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and other tasks using decision trees.
The Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from a randomly selected subset of the training set. It is basically a set of decision trees (DT) from a randomly selected subset of the training set and then It collects the votes from different decision trees to decide the final prediction.

<h2>üìä K Nearest Neighbor: </h2>
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both regression and classification. KNN tries to predict the correct class for the test data by calculating the distance between the test data and all the training points. Then select the K number of points which is closest to the test data. The KNN algorithm calculates the probability of the test data belonging to the classes of ‚ÄòK‚Äô training data and class which holds the highest probability will be selected.
